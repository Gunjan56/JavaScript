//Encapsulation => it is the concept of public and private object properties of javascript
//all objects properties and methods are public by defualt
//it is the concept of bundling data and method that operate on that data into a single unit, known as an object
//it aims to hide the internal state and implementation details of an object
//in js we use # start of name to declare a private property
